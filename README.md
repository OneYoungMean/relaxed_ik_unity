# relaxed_ik_unity
This is the Unity wrapper of RelaxedIK designed to be run on Windows. Note that it probably wonâ€™t work on a linux machine. The simulation of a few commonly used robot arms have already been set up for you to play with. You will be able to disable and enable RelaxedIK as you like. When RelaxedIK is disabled, a joint angle writer panel will show up for you to modify the joint angle configuration. When RelaxedIK is enabled, you will be able to have real-time interactions with the robot and RelaxedIK by dragging the transform gizmo associated with the gripper of the robot

## Rust Dependencies (Not optional)
To use this wrapper, you will first need to install Rust. https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

If you plan to extend any of the Rust code, we recommend using the Jetbrains rust plugin.

## Install
1. Install Unity.
2. Clone this repo to your windows machine and open the subdirectory RelaxedIK as a Unity Project.
3. Initialize relaxed_ik_core (The core part of relaxed IK written in Rust) as a submodule by running the following command in the project directory: 
	```
	git submodule update --init
	```
   
## Run
1. Click play in Unity.
2. Hold left Alt key and use your mouse to navigate the camera.
3. Use the GUI at the left side to play with the robot arm.
4. Set a robot arm as active to play with it. Make sure only one robot arm is active at the same time.

## Steps of setting up a robot arm
1. Generate config files for the robot arm with [relaxed_ik](https://github.com/uwgraphics/relaxed_ik).
   + Start configs in the info file should be float numbers (e.g., 0.0), otherwise Unity might crash.
2. Follow the steps at [ros-sharp wiki](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/User_App_NoROS_ImportURDFOnWindows) to set up the simulation of your robot arm.
   + Please make sure that the urdf file has inertia information in it, otherwise the joints may not be set up correctly.
3. Once the robot arm is loaded, add the RelaxedIKUnity script to it. Set up the list of robot Limbs and end effectors by dragging and dropping the corresponding game object to the list. The gripper prefab can be found at `Assets/Prefabs/Gripper`.
4. On the component of the UrdfRobot script, enable Is Kinematic and All Convex Colliders and disable Use Gravity and Use Inertia from URDF.
5. Optional: Add a child named `ViewCenter` tot the robot arm to configure the position of the camera at runtime.

## Known Issues
1. In order to transform the orginal coordinate system in rviz to fit inside Unity, I write some hard code in RelaxedIKUnity.cs.
2. When the end effector is dragged to some point that the robot arm cannot reach (e.g. not long enough), EEPoseGoals go out of the range.
3. For the sawyer robot arm, dragging the gripper in the x (or y) axis will lead to changes in the y (or x) coordinate of the pose goal.
4. For yumi and panda, relaxed IK doesn't run very smoothly, might be the problem of their config files
